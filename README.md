Sudoku visualiser
-----------------

"You might lose the fun in solving Sudoku puzzles 
but I certainly had fun writing this HTML5 app."


Run directly on GitHub: http://richardeigenmann.github.io/Sudoku/

Testing: Runs OK on Chrome and Firefox for Linux as well as Chrome for Android
Not running on XP with old IE.

Description: This app draws a Sudoku grid and allows the user to pick the numbers 
she wants to place in the grid. As each number is picked the options 
that are no longer possible are removed. If a number is "forced" because it
is the only one that can take that place in the row, colum or grid then 
it is highlighted. 
The steps and puzzle can be saved by clicking the save button. To reload
a saved puzzle drag the saved file over the list of steps.

Motivation: In Switzerland, where I live, Sudoku is so pupular that the
free newspapers have two puzzles in every edition. I and my partner sometimes
like to compete against each other solving them. I usually need to copy 
out the puzzle to a larger piece of paper so that I have enough space to 
can write down the numbers that are possible and do the exclusion logic. I have
long felt that I should be able to do this on the computer so here it is. I do 
admit, it does take the challenge out of solving the puzzles and the sense of
achievement is not the same.
